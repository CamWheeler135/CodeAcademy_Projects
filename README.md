# Codecademy Projects

### Welcome

Hello, welcome to my repo of codecademy courses!

My motivation behind creating this repo is to try and prepare as well as I can for my master course starting in September. I want to arrive with as much knowledge and understanding as possible and I feel that taking courses will be the best way to be consistent with my learning.

This repo is where I will be uploading the final projects of all the courses, for a list of completed courses and courses currently being taken, see the [courses subsection](#courses-courses-id). 

Within each final project, there will be a short README explaining some information on the project, the data being used, my aims, and what I am trying to learn / implement. 

Codecademy also allows for *some* projects taken at the end of topics / modules (mini projects) to be done offline as well. You can find these in their respective career paths prefaced with 'Mini". All final project directories will begin with 'Main".
