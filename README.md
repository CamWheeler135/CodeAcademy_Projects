# Codecademy Repo

## Welcome

Hello, welcome to my repo of codecademy courses!

This repo is where I will be uploading the things I am doing on codecademy.

Within each project, there will be a short README explaining some information on the project, the data being used, my aims, and what I am trying to learn / implement. 

Codecademy also allows for *some* projects taken at the end of topics / modules (mini projects) to be done offline as well. You can find these in their respective career paths prefaced with 'Mini".
