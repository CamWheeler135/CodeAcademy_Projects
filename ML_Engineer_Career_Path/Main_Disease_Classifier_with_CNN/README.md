# Can we use Your Immune Cell Data to Predict if you Have a Disease?

### ❗️Project Currently Being Built❗️

## TLDR ⚠️

Being able to accurately diagnose cancer is crucial for appropriate and effective treatment. Current methods used in cancer diagnosis look at imaging, biopsies and lab tests. In the age of next generation sequencing (NGS) we can quickly and cost effectively sequence cells producing HUGE amounts of data that we can analyze using machine learning methods. Our adaptive immune system is what allows us to combat disease that our innate immune system would not recognize 🦠, a key part of this is the T cell. This project aims to use a deep learning model (CNN) to see if we can discriminate the specific cancer (solid tumour) a patient has presented with based on their repertoire data. Being able to do such a task could lead to another tool in the clinicians arsenal when it comes to diagnosing patients.

## Introduction
This is supposed to be a rather informal project, if you are looking for some formal papers on the subject, I have linked plenty in [this section](#papers-and-interesting-articles-📚). 

### Aims
My aims for this project are:
- Further investigate immune data and its usefulness in building clinical machine learning models.
- Increase my understanding of end to end project building. 
- Learn PyTorch fundamentals. 

### Data
The data being used in the project is coming from the TCR data base [(TCRdb)](http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/TCRdb/#/browse). In this project we are focusing on classifying different types of solid tumours.

- Esophageal
- Breast
- Gastric
- Liver
- Lung 
- Glioblastoma 
- Ovarian
- Head and Neck
- Colorectal
- Pancreatic

It is worth noting that there is some class imbalance here, some cancers contain a larger number of repertoires than others so we will have to deal with this in the preprocessing stage to ensure that our model is effective.
