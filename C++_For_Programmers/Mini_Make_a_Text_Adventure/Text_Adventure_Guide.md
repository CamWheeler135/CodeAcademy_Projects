### Text Adventure Guide

The idea is to make a text adventure game.

Our program should include a beginning and at least 3 endings. 

Our program should also include at least 3 branches that the user can take.

    - At each branch the user should have at least 2 choices. 
    - To make their choice the program should ask the user for input. 

Our program should contain at least 1 loop. 

    - To validate user input (e.g., check if the user entered something other than your listed choices and then list the choices again).
    - To give the user multiple chances to choose a specific outcome (e.g., give a user three chances to pick an option that wonâ€™t get them killed).
    - To continue the adventure until the user makes a particular choice.

Our program should use conditional logic such as if-else statements and switch statements. 

#### Story

In the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, the merciless forces of Chaos were not the only threat that plagued the Imperium of Man. On a desolate world, a battalion of Space Marines, led by Captain Valerius of the Ultramarines, face an overwhelming horde of Orks led by the cunning Warboss Grukk. You are a powerful Terminator in charge of the unit tasked with defending a flank of the frontline garrison against the impending ork attack. 

Enjoy the game!
